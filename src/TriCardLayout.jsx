                  From a young age, I was always curious about how things
                  workedâ€”especially computers. That curiosity grew into a
                  passion, and it shaped every decision I made through my
                  academic journey. I began my formal education with a strong
                  focus on mathematics and science, always eager to explore how
                  technology could solve real-world problems. This interest only
                  deepened as I progressed through school, where I often found
                  myself fascinated by logic, problem-solving, and the potential
                  of software to bring ideas to life.
